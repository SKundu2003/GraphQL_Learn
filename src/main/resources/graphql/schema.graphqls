#To define the schema of the GraphQL API, we need to define the types and queries that the API will support.
#To fetch the data from the database, we will define a query that will return a list of books and a query that will return a single book by its id.
type Query{
    getAllBooks: [BooksDetails] #return a list of books

    getBookById(id: ID!): BooksDetails #id is a unique identifier
}


type BooksDetails{

    id: ID! # "!" denotes a required field -> can't be null #id is a unique identifier
    title: String!
    author: String!
    description: String
    price: Float!
}
