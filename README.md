Controller Class
The BooksController class serves as the orchestrator, managing requests and responses within the GraphQL API. It facilitates operations such as fetching all books, retrieving books by ID, and adding new books to the database.

CreateBookRequest Class
The CreateBookRequest class defines the structure of input data required for adding a new book. It encapsulates essential details like title, author, description, and price, ensuring seamless data transmission for book creation.

BookService Interface
The BooksService interface outlines the contract for interacting with book-related operations. It provides methods for creating books, fetching books by ID, and retrieving all available books from the database.

Schema Definition
The schema.graphqls file lays the foundation for the GraphQL API, defining types and queries supported by the system. It encompasses mutations for data insertion, input types for parameter passing, and queries for fetching books by various criteria.
