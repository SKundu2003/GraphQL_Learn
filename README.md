# Welcome to GraphQL_Learn ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive exploration of GraphQL integrated with Java Spring Boot. Through hands-on implementation and thorough investigation, I've ventured into the depths of GraphQL APIs, optimizing backend functionality and elevating system efficiency.

## Controller Class
The `BooksController` orchestrates requests and responses within the GraphQL API. It facilitates operations like fetching all books, retrieving books by ID, and adding new books to the database.

## CreateBookRequest Class
The `CreateBookRequest` class defines the structure of input data required for adding a new book. It encapsulates essential details like title, author, description, and price, ensuring seamless data transmission for book creation.

## BookService Interface
The `BooksService` interface outlines the contract for interacting with book-related operations. It provides methods for creating books, fetching books by ID, and retrieving all available books from the database.

## Schema Definition
The `schema.graphqls` file lays the foundation for the GraphQL API, defining types and queries supported by the system. It encompasses mutations for data insertion, input types for parameter passing, and queries for fetching books by various criteria.

## Quick Start
To kickstart your exploration:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java and Spring Boot set up.
3. Explore the codebase, paying special attention to the controller, service, and schema files.
4. Experiment with running the application locally and interacting with the GraphQL API.

## Explore Further
Dive deeper into GraphQL_Learn by:
- Experimenting with custom mutations and queries.
- Enhancing error handling and validation mechanisms.
- Integrating additional features to enrich the application's functionality.
